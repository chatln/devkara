<button>Inscriptions</button>

<p>Facebook earns money by showing ads to its users. Facebook tracks user information and based on that information ads are shown to users, but even after tracking so many signals from Facebook users, Facebook still misses information that you do not share with it, because you are not active on Facebook all the time.

So, here comes WhatsApp with more information which means if you missed telling some information to Facebook but your WhatsApp knows it, well, now Facebook will also come to know ( if you have accepted the latest privacy update).
